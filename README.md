# Uniform Detection with ResNet-50
This GitHub project is focused on utilizing deep learning and computer vision techniques to solve the problem of uniform detection. In scenarios where it's crucial to distinguish between individuals wearing uniforms and those who are not, this project presents a robust solution.

Project Overview
The project employs the following key components:

Data Augmentation: The dataset is enriched through data augmentation techniques, which include rotation, shifting, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping. This helps in enhancing the model's ability to generalize from limited data.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded, preprocessed, and split into training and validation sets. Images are resized to a specified input size to ensure uniformity.

ResNet-50 Model: A pre-trained ResNet-50 model is used as the foundation for the deep learning model. This model is widely recognized for its ability to extract meaningful features from images.

Custom Classification Head: A custom classification head is added on top of the ResNet-50 model to make it suitable for the specific task of uniform detection. It includes layers for global average pooling and fully connected layers with ReLU activation.

Transfer Learning: The pre-trained layers of ResNet-50 are frozen to leverage the knowledge it gained from a large dataset. Only the custom classification layers are trained from scratch.

Model Training: The model is trained using the prepared dataset, and essential callbacks, such as early stopping and model checkpointing, are incorporated to improve training efficiency and save the best-performing model.

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on the validation set, with metrics such as accuracy and loss being monitored.

Model Saving: The final trained model is saved for future use, and the best-performing model during training is also preserved.

Usage
This project provides a powerful tool for detecting uniforms in images. You can use the trained model to make predictions on new data or fine-tune it for your specific use case.
